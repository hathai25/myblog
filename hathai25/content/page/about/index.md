Have you ever wondered, deep inside you, if there's an inner voice that keeps telling you to do this, but reality force you to do differently, things that you don't really want?

Well, each one of us all has that voice that represents our true personality. But it's not that we always have the chance to speak up. We feel stuck. As if there's a stone inside us. 

The problem is, I can't bear living with that stone. I need to find a way to express myself, not to the whole world, just a place to put my words out. 

That's why I created this blog.

To me, it's a diary where I can write anything about my life at school, my coding journey, or some of my opinions. You might find my posts rather personal, but it's mine anyway.

So I hope you'll enjoy it. If not, well, at least thanks for having dropped in.

See you around!
