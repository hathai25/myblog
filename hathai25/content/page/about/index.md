Have you ever wondered, deep inside you, there's an inner voice keep telling you to do this, but reality force you to do differently, the things that you don't really want?

Well in fact each one of us, we're all have that voice, represent our true personality. But it's not that we always have the chance to speak out loud. We feel stuck. As if there's a stone inside us. 

The problem is, I can't bear living with that stone. I need to find a way to express myself, not to the whole world, just a place to put my words in. 

That's why I created this blog.

To me, it's a diary, where I can write literally anything, about my life at school, my coding journey, or some of my opinions. You might sometimes find my posts too personal, but hey, it's mine anyway.

So I hope you'll enjoy. If not, well, at least thanks for having dropped by.

See you around!
