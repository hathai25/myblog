A day can be special in many ways. So does the 9th of May. 

It all started at the beginning of 2018. The year that my life completely changed.

Four years ago, someone stepped into my life. Someone used to be dreamy and mournful at the same time. Someone added laughter and tears to my daily days, emotions, and things that you could never forget.

Someone said yes on this day. Someone received a ring on this day, even though it didn't fit at first. Someone tore me apart on this day, right before many decisive exams - I can still remember I was crying while doing that Toeic test. Someone came back, also on this day, after leaving for half a year, but couldn't stay till the same day four years later.

*Where did we go wrong?*

Maybe it's not someone's fault, it's just life separates us into different paths. You couldn't chase after your dream and become a person I've never known. I achieved more than I can ever think of and become a person I've never expected. We both have gone so far from our path, increasing the distance between us. Do you think so?

I don't know if those years are enough for a lifetime. It's stupid thinking so, but when I try to be in a new relationship or intend to, I just feel like trying to repeat everything in the past. Maybe I let others down, but what can I say?

I'm not trying to be nostalgic or missing someone. In the end, the memories stay, they might haunt you for days and nights, but I've got over that time. Now I can sit back and be calmful recalling everything, with a smile and pity on my face. 

> "Hey, what a love story that was!"

If you ever come across this, just know that I cherish all the things we've been through. All the good and bad memories, all took part in making me who I am today. Maybe one day when everything is long gone, we'll meet again, but as a different, grown person, with all the memories left behind.

*Whatever happened, you and I, we both deserve to be appreciated.*
