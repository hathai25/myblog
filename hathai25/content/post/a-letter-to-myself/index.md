You wake up. Sun is shining, birds are singing, got yourself a hot coffee and look outside the window to watch the sun rise.

What a wonderful start to the day.

But wait, did you forget something? Today's the final exam day. 

Nah, you didn't forget that. In fact, you knew it was coming, like, a month ago. Yeah, a month ago. 

One month ago, you got all your exam schedule. You had prepared and listed out everything you need to do to prepare for all those exams, so no big deal! Everything would be fine.

3 weeks ago, your friend told you about a contest, which you found interesting. Or maybe you didn't think it was that interesting, you just FOMO that you might lost the chance while everyone else didn't. You spent a day just to consider that, and at the end, you say no. But you lost a day.

2 weeks ago, you were assigned a new task. It's a new and challenging one, since you've never worked on such projects before. At this time, you've finished some subjects' tests, and you had barely studied for the last one, the one that would come today. But still, that task was so intriguing, you decided to take that anyway.

1 week ago, you were still working on that project, at the same time studying for the final subject. You're completely stressed out and exhausted. But more and more works kept on coming, just like Murphy's law:

> *"Anything that can go wrong will go wrong."*

You started to feel hopeless. 3 days to the exam, you had only studied half the subject.  
2 days to the exam, still no progress. 1 day to the exam..

Tik tok, tik tok. Time still ticking.

1 day to the exam. You felt hopeless. How come everything always has to come at once? 

Well, it's not something new these days. I mean, we all have plenty of works to do. Some we can control. Some we can't.

But hey, things still need to be done. It's our responsibility to do that. We can't control what's coming to us, but we can control our emotion and act. How you face challenges, how you solve them, you're the one who decide. 

It's okay to not be okay. But promise me, you'll be strong afterwards. Take a step back, like get some sleep, and return stronger then ever. Promise me you won't give up, because you've tried so hard to go this far. 

Better days will come, I promise.
